@ Notes:   In this pdf file, I gave the detailed derivations of the famous 
		   Hierarchical Equations Of Motion(HEOM), which describe 
		   the dissipative propagation of the reduced density matrix.

@ Notes:	1 Tanimura and Kubo, 1989
			2 Just google Yijing Yan, or Qiang Shi, or Ishizaki, who are all important HEOM experts.
